### Steps to creat a respository

1. Created a folder to keep our project in
2. Created a README.md, optionally created another file
3. We 'git add .' to stage files to be committed
4. We 'git commit -m "initial commit" to create initial commit
5. Now create remote repository (github.com/new)
6. Connect using git remove add origin <github url>
7. Next, type 'git push -u origin master' in order to set the upstream (default) location to origin (repository) master (branch) in github
